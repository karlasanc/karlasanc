# Hi there, my name is **Karla**! ðŸ‘‹
I'm an Insurance Professional at USAA and student at the University of Arizona Global Campus. I've lived in sunny Florida since 2019, but I will always be a Texan at heart! In my spare time I enjoy spending time on the water kayaking and paddleboarding, I love watching all kinds of movies, and lately I've taken an interest in the art of pixel making without technology - cross-stitching!

ðŸ”­ ðŸŒ±I'm currently working on switching careers into IT as a Software Developer. I'm estimated to graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Software Technology in May 2023. There I'm improving my software development skills and exploring different ways I can create useful applications.

ðŸ‘¯ Now I am looking to take the next step and find my first software development job where I can continue to grow in the field of IT! I have a team first mindset, I am coachable, and am eager to put my best foot forward in my new career.

âš¡ Fun fact: My first project was a dynamic HTML-based website devoted to Johnny Depp that including several clickable pages that displayed his biography, pictures, and random fun facts. I originally took the course on accident in 2009 and fell in love with creating things with words. Despite my love for technology, and my many tech support jobs, I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in French. It wasn't until 2019 that I not only realized I took a software development course, I also realized this was the career I've been chasing for years.
