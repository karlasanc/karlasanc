# Hi there, my name is **Karla**! ðŸ‘‹
I'm an Insurance Professional at USAA and student at the University of Arizona Global Campus. I've lived in sunny Florida since 2019, but I will always be a Texan at heart! In my spare time I enjoy spending time on the water kayaking and paddleboarding, I love watching all kinds of movies, and lately I've taken an interest in the art of pixel making without technology - cross-stitching!

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on switching careers into IT as a Software Developer. I'm estimated to graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Software Technology in May 2023. 

ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm working on improving my software development skills and exploring different ways I can use and improve these skills to create useful applications.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects to improve my software development skills and help others along the way!

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help in any of the above - including landing my first software development job! 

ðŸ“« Feel free to reach me via email at ksanch7@gmail.com.

âš¡ Fun fact: My first project was a dynamic HTML-based website devoted to Johnny Depp that including several clickable pages that displayed his biography, pictures, and random fun facts. I originally took the course on accident in 2009 and fell in love with creating things with words. Despite my love for technology, and my many tech support jobs, I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in French. It wasn't until 2019 that I not only realized I took a software development course, I also realized this was the career I've been chasing for years.
