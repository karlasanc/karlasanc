 ## Hi there, my name is **Karla**! 👋

🌎 I live in sunny Florida. 

🎒 Graduate from the University of Arizona Global Campus with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Software Technology in October 2023.

💻 Looking forward to merging customer service, meticulous problem-solving, and newly acquired software development skills to build innovative technologies for the future.

📧 I've been working on building my online presence; feel free to reach out if you have any feedback on my projects. I am super open to feedback. My contact details are below.

🌱 I am currently teaching myself Laravel and brushing up on my knowledge of Python. I learned all the basics of how to code with Python, but the majority of the programs I completed in my studies were in PHP. 

📱 Feel free to reach out with any feedback or resources; I am open to feedback, especially related to my website/portfolio. My contact details and website link are below:
