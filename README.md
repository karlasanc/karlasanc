# Hi there, my name is **Karla**!

I currently live in Florida. I graduated from the University of Arizona Global Campus with a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering in July 2023. I've been working on building my online presence, so if you happen to catch an error, feel free to let me know! I've been in the IT for at least a decade, but strictly in the troublehsooting and user testing side. I look forward to merging my amazing customer service, meticulous problem solving, and newly acquired software development skills to building innovated technologies. 

ðŸŒ± When I'm not in front of the computer, I am typically watching a movie, working on my next cross-stitching project, or adventuring along the alligators in the Florida swamps on a kayak. (just kidding about the swamps lol)

ðŸ“« I can be reached via email at karla.a.sanchez@outlook.com. If you want to know more about me, visit my new website! [karlasanchez.us](https://karlasanchez.us).

âš¡ Fun fact: The first time I fell in love with the things technology could do was when my brother and I discovered Paint on our home computer in the early 2000s. We would fight over who got to use the computer next and all we would do was play on paint. We never did get good at it. :D
