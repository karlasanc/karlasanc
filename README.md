### Hi there, my name is **Karla**! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving my Python skills, and exploring different ways Python is used in the technology world. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently finishing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Software Technology at the University of Arizona Global Campus with an estimated completion of May 2023. I recently took up cross-stitching (the original pixelated art before computers), and teaching myself the art of a sewing machine!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects to improve my software development skills.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help in any of the above - including landing my first software develpment job!
